                        “Social business can unleash the power of the youth and technology and solve the world's
                        problems much faster and also in a sustainable way. Social business is essential for our safety
                        and security.” The uprising led by the students and youth was initially aimed at ending
                        discrimination. Progressively the movement evolved into a people's movement. The world
                        eventually saw how people-at-large stood against autocracy, oppression, discrimination,
                        injustice and corruption, both on the streets and online.
